## Seletion of Student Evaluations

> "Qian is a great instructor. I really enjoyed the time that he explained more about the game theory. I think his classes would be better if he combined doing exercise with recapping lecture materials(even if just for a few minutes). Overall, I think Qian's way of teaching is enjoyable. As the only student who participated in every discuss session this semester, I want to thank Qian for his instruction!"

> "I enjoyed taking this course, was definitely very challenging but Mr Li. was very informative and helped a lot in explaining questions."

> "Qian was very helpful and encouraging when it came to meeting with him during office hours and asking questions outside of the class period. My only real critique was that I frequently found we were not given enough time to evaluate and attempt the problems by ourselves before they were discussed and solved by Qian. I also think he sometimes rushed through lessons and explanations when a slower approach would have been appreciated. Regardless, I always found attending section to be beneficial for reviewing exam materials."

> "Qian Li is awesome, he is always available to answer questions and is great at doing so. His office hours are always very helpful for me as well."

> "Qian was extremely helpful in further explaining the material from the course. He always offered in depth explanations to help ensure everyone understood the problems and was always willing to help any of the students with the material."

> "He helped explain so many things that I didn't understand in class, and I was really glad to have Qian Li as my instructor!"

> "Qian Li was very understanding and would go through each question during discussion sections as well as he could"

> "I thought Qian Li was a fantastic GSI. I would look forward to going to his discussion section as he would teach the material perfectly fly, and would fill all of the wholes that were left from the lectures."
